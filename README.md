# TidyTuesdayWk24-GreatLakes

This is a group project presented by Siqi Li, Mariam Olupitan, Caroline Valade and Joshua Allard from DSBA5122 Class taught by Prof. Jinwen Qiu in Summer 2021 at UNCC.

Our main objective was to build an application that could identify which species and what type of fish needed to be restocked in which areas of the Great Lakes.
